# rdm-dataverse-belgium
Dataverse project community in Belgium.

The Dataverse Belgium community was started to share and exchange experiences and information between Belgium Dataverse installations.

The community is organized in a Zulip community (https://dataverse-belgium.zulipchat.com/) and uses this GitHub wiki (https://github.com/libis/rdm-dataverse-belgium/wiki) as its knowledge base to register relevant information.
